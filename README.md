# Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing involves the reading and understanding of spoken or written language through the medium of a computer.

Natural language processing (NLP) is the relationship between computers and human language. More specifically, natural language processing is the computer understanding, analysis, manipulation, and/or generation of natural language.
Natural language refers to speech analysis in both audible speech, as well as text of a language. NLP systems capture meaning from an input of words (sentences, paragraphs, pages, etc.) in the form of a structured output (which varies greatly depending on the application). Natural language processing is a fundamental element of artificial intelligence.

## Sentiment Classification

Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. A sentiment analysis system for text analysis combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to assign weighted sentiment scores to the entities, topics, themes and categories within a sentence or phrase.

This projects uses different datasets that contain some reviews with the respective sentiment or label ( 1 - Positive, 0 - Negative ), such as Amazon Reviews, IMDB Reviews and Yelp Reviews. The tested model was a Linear Support Vector Machine, getting an 77.6 % Accuracy. 

## Spam Text Classification

The use of mobile phones has skyrocketed in the last decade leading to a new area for junk promotions from disreptable marketers. People innocently give out their mobile phone numbers while utilizing day to day services and are then flooded with spam promotional messages.

In this project I create a classifier or SMS messages using different Machine Learning models, understand why this is an important area in the Natural Language Processing
